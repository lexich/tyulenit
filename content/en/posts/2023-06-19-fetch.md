It seems that there is no such project that does not need to make requests to the server. And it is always a good idea to write a separate abstraction to describe such communication. This not only adds readability and reusability to the code, but also makes it possible to quickly and efficiently write tests for such functionality.

```ts
class NetworkService {
    constructor(private readonly fetch: typeof fetch) {}
    getUser: (): Promise<IUser> => this.fetch('/api/user').then(d => d.json())
}

function getUsername(api: Pick<NetworkService, 'getUser'>) {
    return api.getUser().then(user => user.name);
}

test('getUsername', async () => {
    const name = await getUsername({
        getUser: () => Promise.resolve({ name: 'test' } as IUser)
    });
    expect(name).toBe('test');
});
```

And for an average project, this approach will be sufficient. But sometimes there are requirements that you need to redefine the `fetch` itself. For example, in our project, we are developing an extension for the browser and we want to make requests through the serviceWorker. And there is a requirement to reimplement the `Fetch API`. As we know, fetch returns a `Response` primitive, for the creation of which you need to pass the `ReadableStream` as the first argument, and the response characteristics as the second. Thus, we can use the following construction.

```ts
function buildFetchEmulator(
  controller: (url: RequestInfo, init: RequestInit | undefined) =>
    Promise<[ResponseInit, (add: (msg: object) => void) => Promise<void>]>
) {
  const cFetch: typeof fetch = async (url, init) => {
    // extract the response characteristics and the controller that will generate the data
    const [responseInit, ctrl] = await controller(url, init);

    // describe the behavior of ReadableStream
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      async start(controller) {
        try {
          const enc = new TextEncoder();
          await ctrl((msg) => {
            // convert the object to a string
            const message = JSON.stringify(msg);
            // string in Uint8Array
            const buf = enc.encode(message);
            // transfer data to the ReadableStream controller
            controller.enqueue(buf);
          });
          controller.close();
        } catch (err) {
          controller.error(err);
          controller.close();
        }
      },
    });

    return new Response(stream, responseInit);
  };

  return cFetch;
}

test('getUser', () => {
    const customFetch = buildFetchEmulator(async (url, init) => {
        if (url === '/api/user') {
            return [{
                headers: new Headers({ 'content-type': contentType }),
                status: 200,
                statusText: 'OK',
            }, async (add) => {
                // Here we can use any logic for data transport
                add({ name: 'test' })
            }];
        }
        throw new Error('not implemented');
    })
    const network = new NetworkService();

    const name = await getUsername(network);
    expect(name).toBe('test');
});
```

Here I would like to emphasize once again that for cases when there is no need to emulate `fetch` and write custom adapters, the first method is much more concise and convenient, but with this approach we can test even external libraries that use `fetch` directly, for example like `@microsoft/fetch-event-source`.
